- MMAE 410 Flight Mechanics - wrote new syllabus to move away from a textbook-based approach, and wrote own 260-page accompanying notes, with interactive MATLAB-based problems for students.
- MMAE 315 and 319 Aerospace/Mechanical Laboratory - developed refreshed syllabus to teach students in the fundamentals of experimental methods, drawing from my own industrial experience.
- MMAE 304 Mechanics of Aerostuctures, developed a new syllabus to teach students the method of virtual work, and giving coursework in writing Finite-Element codes in MATLAB, and Python.
- Proposed, developed, and delivered new syllabus for MMAE 100 Introduction to the Profession; taught as a course to aerospace majors, gave students grounding in aeronautical fundamentals such as aircraft anatomy, basic aircraft performance, and fundamentals of propulsion. 
- Led two students in Summer 2019 in development of `adaptive blade element code', as proof-of-concept of modelling technique. Students continuing work as MMAE 594 in 2020.
