%\begin{cvitems}
%	\item During my PhD studies, I was responsible for delivering half of the course `Propulsion and Turbomachinery III', providing lectures on propeller theory - working from actuator disc theory, through BEMT models into basic vortex theory.
%	\item I delivered lectures in `Aircraft Vibration and Aeroelasticity IV' for my supervisor to cover absences at short notice. 
%	\item Led class-based tutorials in~\textsl{Applied Mechanics I \& II},~~\textsl{Aircraft Design IV},~~\textsl{Rotorcraft Aerodynamics IV},~~\textsl{Propulsion and Turbomachinery III}, and~~\textsl{Numerical Methods IV}.
