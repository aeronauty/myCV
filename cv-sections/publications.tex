\cvsection{Publications}
Commercial restrictions during my own PhD studies have made publication of IP problematic, but I have written a review paper `Engineering Models for Aircraft Propellers at Incidence' that is currently in review for Progress in Aerospace Sciences. Following from my PhD research, I have developed a vortex based methodology and have written a conference paper in conjunction with my PhD student at Glasgow University - we aim to present this work at AHS 2018 and publish as a journal paper once the validation is complete.
