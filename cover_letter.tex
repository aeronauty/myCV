%Dear JT4,
Please find attached my resume and CV for consideration for the Aerospace Engineer role.

As you will see from my career history, I have a wealth of pertinent experience in each of the responsibilities and duties for this role. I was a senior wind tunnel aerospace engineer at the Aircraft Research Association, where I designed, conducted, and analyzed experiments. During this time I was instrumental in large design studies to explore motor upgrades and pneumatic systems within the 30MW facility; I have acted at roles from technical specialist through to technical manager on different projects. 

At present I am employed as a professor at Illinois Tech, and my wife is a USAF Captain. She is moving to a role at Nellis AFB in May, hence our relocation to Las Vegas. Concurrently with my teaching, I have been performing research in propeller aerodynamics and machine learning; I have several papers submitted and expect publication shortly. I also own my own consulting company and have taken charge of the aircraft design process for a large UAV firm.

I have enjoyed developing the next generation of aerospace engineers during my time at Illinois Tech, but I miss being involved in \textsl{real} engineering. It will be a pleasure to become part of your company and the exciting work performed.

I would appreciate the chance to expand upon my career history, and to learn more about this role if fortunate enough to gain an interview. I am originally from the UK and the resume/CV distinction is new unfamiliar to me. I have attached a short single-page resume and a longer three-page document that goes into further detail about my achievements.

Thank you for your time and consideration.



%\cvparagraph{About Me}
%
%I have worked in aircraft aerodynamics since my graduation in 2010, through my PhD, and thereafter as a professional researcher for four years at Europe's most productive transonic wind tunnel. In 2018 I moved to Chicago so my wife could be closer to home (she is a USAF Officer, and was stationed in the UK), so I took a position as a lecturer at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

%\cvparagraph{Why Wilson?}
%
%I am fit and healthy, and would love to work for a company in the sports industry - I play squash (adequately) when I get a chance, though I have yet to find a partner for the sport in the US! The role looks like it is an excellent fit for my skill set, and I am eager to find a set of new problems to sink my teeth into. 
%
%\cvparagraph{Why Me?}
%Through my time I have worked with a fusion of experimental and numerical methods - utilising RANS CFD for Turbomachinery investigation, developing my own vortex-lattice models for propellers at incidence, and developing novel methods for capturing flow data for transonic experiments. I feel there has been a blurring of the demarcation between experimental and numerical aerodynamics, and I consider myself fortunate to have strong abilities in both fields. I have a demonstrated passion for my discipline, and I am able to adapt easily to new problems and circumstances.
